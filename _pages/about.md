I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in City Modelling at [The Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and a Senior Assistant at [The Chair of Geoinformation Engineering](https://gis.ethz.ch/en/), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).

Research
---------

My research focuses on development of computational methods for analysing built environments and human behavior in cities. It is motivated by questions in urban mobility, land-use, housing, social and health inequalities. The goals are:

* making quantitative measurements at high spatio-temporal resolution using emerging sources of digital data,
* estimating the influence of spatial factors on individual behaviour and outcomes, and
* characterising change and its drivers
 
in the context of cities.


Short Bio
---------

I recieved my PhD degree in Urban Systems and Transport Planning from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urban-systems-lab/) in 2016. I also hold a BSc. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Sabanci University](https://me.sabanciuniv.edu/) and an MSE degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University of Michigan](https://me.engin.umich.edu/). 

After my PhD, I joined the [Global Environmental Health Research Group](www.globalenvhealth.org) as postdoc working for the Wellcome Trust funded [Pathways to Equitable Healthy Cities](https://equitablehealthycities.org/) project. In 2018, I was awarded an MRC Rutherford Fellowship based at the [MRC Center for Environment and Health](https://environment-health.ac.uk/). As part of my training, I was a Visiting Scholar at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/). I also worked as a Senior Data Scientist (part-time) at the [Swiss Data Science Center at ETH Zurich](https://datascience.ch/) between 2018 and 2021. 

In October 2021, I joined [the Chair of Geoinformation Engineering at ETH Zurich](https://gis.ethz.ch/en/) as Senior Assistant. Since June 2022, I am a Lecturer in City Modelling at [UCL CASA](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/).
