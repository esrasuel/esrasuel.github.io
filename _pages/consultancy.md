Since 2010, in addition to my academic research, I worked in various research and consultancy projects funded by the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home), [International Finance Cooperation (IFC)](https://www.ifc.org/), [World Resources Institute (WRI)](https://www.wri.org/), [Istanbul Stock Exchange](https://www.borsaistanbul.com/en/), [British Council in Turkey](https://www.britishcouncil.org.tr/en), and [General Consulate of Sweden in Turkey](https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/embassies/turkey-istanbul/) led by [Idema Global](https://idemaglobal.com/), [WRI Turkiye Sustainable Cities](https://wrisehirler.org/), and [Sabanci University Corporate Governance Forum](https://cgft.sabanciuniv.edu/en). I will try to add more information soon.
